# shape-notes
Software associated with coloured shape notes for music. The shape notes use the popular Aikin convention to show tonic solfa. Colours are based on the circle of fifths and are optimised for colour blindness.

For now I've made the Wickiâ€“Hayden multi-touch keyboard available at [https://speechchemistry.github.io/shape-notes/major_notes_with_touch_online.html](https://speechchemistry.github.io/shape-notes/major_notes_with_touch_online.html) . It needs a lot of refactoring.

The work relies on the shapes defined in Musescore, and makes use of the WebAudioFontPlayer.js . This is why the license is GPL.
